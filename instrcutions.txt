Bot defaults:
- bass = 0 and treble = 0

Playing songs:
- /play <name or url>
- /add <name or url> for adding more
- /next to play next
- To exit bot use /leave
- If url is a playlist all songs will be added to queue
- /leave will make bot leave channel and clear all resources

Playing songs with bass and treble:
- the commands are same but if bass and treble are set, the values apply to every song you add or play until you change.
- if you want different bass and treble values then do this:
- - /bass 1
- - /treble 1
- - /play hello (here the song plays with bass is 1 and treble is 1)
- - /bass 2
- - /add hi (here the song plays with bass is 2 and treble is 1)
- - /treble 2
- - /add yoo (here the song plays with bass is 2 and treble is 2)
- Once finished playing all songs, set bass and treble back to zero so that it doesnt affect other song additions.

Warnings:
- Due to unavailability of spotify premium, if spotify link is provided, it gets the data of the songs
  and searches in youtube and adds to queue
- In case wrong songs are put in queue find correct song from youtube and add using /add <url>

Have a nice time playing songs! ü§ù
